# hello-world


Hello GitHub geeks!

I am Suraj Bhatia and I am doing my Masters in Computer Networks and Security. 
I have interests in working on projects related to Cloud, Linux and Internet Protocols & Architecture and I see open-source as a
great way to learn.

I am proficient in Python, Shell scripting, Linux/UNIX Networking and Administration and have a great urge to work or projects related to Cloud, Software-Defined Networks, Virtualization and Network Security.

Hope to interact with everyone!
